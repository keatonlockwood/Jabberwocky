            In the poem by Lewis Carrol, the reader is placed into a literal Wonderland.<br>Everything is make believe.
            Much like the internet, these things don't exist in the physical world.<br>These computed animations are created out of thin air using nothing but computer programming.
              <p id="last-line">
                The programmed animations are meant to represent the fantasyland of the Jabberwocky.
